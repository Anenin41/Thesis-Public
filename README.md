# About
In this repository one can find every file that is related with the creation (or modification) of Shallow Water Moment models with Rainfall and Infiltration dynamics[^1]. The repository has the following structure:

```text
.
├── model
├── report
│   └── Extras
└── utils
```


In addition, it is also standard practice that executable files are never uploaded to GitHub repositoties. As such, files like figures, graphs, images, executables, binaries, etc..., are not uploaded here. However all of these are stored locally, and I can provide frequent updates in the form of `.zip` files upon request.

# Model
Under construction...

# Report
The `.tex` files that compose the report of the project.

# Utils
Helper scripts and functions for data collection, manipulation and backup.
