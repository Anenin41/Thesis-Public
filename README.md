# Summary
This repository stores every file that is related with the thesis project for the Master of Science in Applied Mathematics at the University of Groningen. It is on purpose left incomplete so it doesn't contain personal information (names, work emails, student number, etc...), to prevent personal data leakage to Microsoft as much as possible.


In addition, it is also standard practice that executable files are never uploaded to GitHub repositoties. As such, files like figures, graphs, images, executables, binaries, etc..., are not uploaded here. In case there is need to check the complete version of this repository, I can provide a `.zip` file via email ([kgaras041@gmail.com](mailto:kgaras041@gmail.com). 

Lastly, the majority of the files and structure of this project will evolve and change over time. Frequent updates and overhauls are to be expected. Supposedly, each sub-directory in this repository should have a standalone `README.md` file that explains the documentation and usage of scripts or `.tex` files.
